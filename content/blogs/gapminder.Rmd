Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, we will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, we will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.



```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)
#countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", 
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hiv1<-hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:34,names_to="date",values_to="hiv_rate") %>% 
  print()

life_exp<-life_expectancy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:302,names_to="date",values_to="life_exp") %>% 
  print()
  
# Change "hiv$year" and "life_exp$year"from character to integer 
hiv1$date<-as.integer(hiv1$date)
life_exp$date<-as.integer(life_exp$date)

worldbankdata1<-worldbank_data %>% 
  select(c(-iso2c,-iso3c))
```

I use a mutating join, specifically the full join for the datasets, where it keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables, so I can include those countries and dates that are only in one of the datasets.

```{r}
df<-full_join(worldbankdata1,hiv1,by=c("country","date"))
data<-full_join(df,life_exp,by=c("country","date"))
```

## The relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy
```{r}
# We winsorize these potentially unbounded variables at the  1% and 99% extremes to mitigate the influence of outliers in life_exp.

#We first add regions to our dataset.
region<-countries %>% 
  select(country,region) 

data_new<-left_join(region,data,by="country")

data_new %>% 
  select(country,region,date,life_exp,hiv_rate) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=life_exp,y=hiv_rate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red")+
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~region,scales="free")+
  labs (
    title = "Relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy",
    x="Life expectancy",
    y="HIV rate"
  )
```

It seems that Hiv prevalence have an overall negative relationship with life expectance, especially demonstrated by the statistics in Sub-saharan Africa, where there are relatively more samples of HIV, and shows a clearer pattern.

```{r}
data_new%>% 
  select(country,date,SP.DYN.TFRT.IN,NY.GDP.PCAP.KD,region) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=NY.GDP.PCAP.KD,y=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita",
    x="GDP per capita",
    y="Fertility rate"
  )+
  facet_wrap(~region)
```

In general, fertility rate decreases when GDP per capita increases, implying that richer countries and times have generally lower fertility. However the pattern is different in places like Middle east & north africa and Sub-saharan africa, with many outliers suggesting that GPD per capita actually decrease when the fertility rate goes too high -- which means the population is too large.

## Regions have the most observations with missing HIV data

```{r}

data1<-data_new %>% 
  select(region,hiv_rate) %>% 
  mutate(missing_hiv=case_when(
    is.na(hiv_rate)~1,
    TRUE~0
  )) 
  
data1 %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(missing=sum(missing_hiv)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(missing)) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=missing,y=reorder(region,missing))) + 
    geom_col()+
    labs(
      title="Top 5 regions with most missing HIV data",
      x="number of missing data",
      y="region"
    )
```

Europe & Central Asia, Sub-saharan africa, Latin America, East Asia, and Middle Asia are the regions with most missing HIV data.

## Mortality rates and improvement

```{r}

growth_rate<-data_new %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(Diff_year = date - lag(date),  # Difference in time (just in case there are gaps)
         Diff_growth = SH.DYN.MORT - lag(SH.DYN.MORT), # Difference in mortality rate between years
         Rate_percent = (Diff_growth / Diff_year)/SH.DYN.MORT * 100)

Average_growth<-growth_rate %>% 
  group_by(region,country) %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(Rate_percent, na.rm = TRUE)) 

Average_growth
```

```{r}
#These are the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement in each region (largest negative growth in mortality rates):

Top5_eastasia<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="East Asia & Pacific")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print()

Top5_europe<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="Europe & Central Asia")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print()

Top5_latin<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="Latin America & Caribbean")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print()

Top5_middleeast<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="Middle East & North Africa")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print()

Top5_north<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="North America")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print()

Top5_south<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="South Asia")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print()

Top5_sub<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="Sub-Saharan Africa")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  print()
```

```{r}
#These are the top 5 countries that have seen the least improvement in each region (largest positive growth in mortality rates):

Bottom5_eastasia<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="East Asia & Pacific")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  tail(5) %>% 
  print()

Bottom5_europe<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="Europe & Central Asia")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  tail(5) %>% 
  print()

Bottom5_latin<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="Latin America & Caribbean")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  tail(5) %>% 
  print()

  filter(region=="Middle East & North Africa")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  tail(5) %>% 
  print()

Bottom5_north<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="North America")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  tail(5) %>% 
  print()

Bottom5_south<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="South Asia")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  tail(5) %>% 
  print()

Bottom5_sub<-Average_growth %>% 
  filter(region=="Sub-Saharan Africa")%>% 
  arrange(mean) %>% 
  tail(5) %>% 
  print()
```

## Relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate

```{r}
data_new%>% 
  select(country,date,SP.DYN.TFRT.IN,SE.PRM.NENR,region) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN,y=SE.PRM.NENR))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate",
    x="Fertility rate",
    y="Primary school enrollment"
  )+
  facet_wrap(~region,scales="free")
```

According to the graph, primary school enrollment rate decreases when fertility rate increase. This makes sense since having too much population can make the educational service over-burdened, and not enough vacancies are left -- which leads to lower enrollment rate.

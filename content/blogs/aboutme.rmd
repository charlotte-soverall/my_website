# Short biography written using markdown

> # Charlotte Soverall's Biography 
I am *‘third culture kid’*. Every generation in my family has moved to a new country navigating ever-changing environments. My grandparents were invitees from the early Windrush generation settling here in London. My parents become expatriates soon after I was born. I grew up in a diverse and international expat community. I am the sum total of all these experiences. I am able to not only adapt quickly to change but also thrive. I strive to find new opportunities.  I have and appreciate diversity of thought; collaborating easily with people whose backgrounds differ from my own and valuing their perspectives. This is also what led me to currently study a Masters of Financial Analysis at London Business School; an international community routed in collaboration. 
I have a passion for social upliftment in communities, specifically female empowerment. It was because of this that I volunteered for a year in 2018 for PhaphamaSEDI and again in 2019; where for the first-time females represented 50% of entrepreneurs. In conjunction with my leadership position in Phaphama, I also completed a Women in Leadership course at the University of Stellenbosch Business School (to find our more about the course <https://www.getsmarter.com/courses/za/women-in-leadership-online-short-course>) to support me in my future career.Other than volunteering my interests include: Reading; I have been in a book club for the past three years, where we meet monthly to discuss the assigned book. The last book I read was Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Secondly; I love writing poetry and short stories. I completed an on-line Creative Writing Course in May with Penguin Random House. The objective was to develop a unique writing voice and teaching skills for effective writing. I am currently writing a short story/potential novel.Thirdly, I have always loved cooking and in June 2019, I attended a short course at Le Corden Bleu in Paris specialising in French food.

# Here's a bit about me!

> 
As  *‘third culture kid’*, born in London, but raised in expatriate communities, I have learned how to successfully navigate change and to embrace challenges. I adapt quickly to change and also to thrive in challenging circumstances. I enjoy seeking new opportunities and appreciate diversity of thought; collaboration with people whose experiences differ from my own and I value their perspectives. This guided my decision to study, a Masters of Financial Analysis at London Business School; an international community rooted in collaboration.

>Other interests
>Firstly; I am passionate about reading and writing and so during my undergraduate degree, I founded a Bookclub. It ran for three years and get to over 30 members. Each member assigned a book and we met monthly to have discussions. This was a wonderful experience and I am subsequently, forming a Female Authors Bookclub at London Business School. My aim is formalise the bookclub and make it an official club at LBS.
Secondly; I love writing poetry and short stories. I completed an on-line Creative Writing Course in May with Penguin Random House. The objective was to develop a unique writing voice and teaching skills for effective writing. I am currently writing a short story/potential novel.
Thirdly, I have always loved cooking and in June 2019, I attended a short course at Le Corden Bleu in Paris specialising in French food. (to find our more about the course <https://www.cordonbleu.edu/paris/culinary-workshop-the-art-of-cooking-like-a-chef/en>).

<p>Let us revisit the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf">CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data</a>. There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use <code>vroom</code> to load it and you keep <code>cache=TRUE</code> in the chunk options.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url &lt;- &quot;https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&quot;

covid_data &lt;- vroom::vroom(url)%&gt;% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn&#39;t work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()</code></pre>
<p>Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not</li>
<li>by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.</li>
</ol>

## Compare Confidence Intervals

The confidence interval for week 15 seems to be a bit stronger than the confidence interval for week 34. Upon reviewing the data set, this didn't make much sense to me, as week 34 had a significantly higher sample size. Intuitively, one would think a higher sample size equates to more certainty. However, after a second look, it seems the 'grade' for the extra pollsters are below average, which could lead to more standard deviation - which would explain the difference in confidence intervals.

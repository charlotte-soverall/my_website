This data has been provided by the CDC Case Surveillance Task Force and last updated on 30 September 2020. In this dataset there are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. As this is a large file, I used `vroom` to load it and kekt `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()


```

Given the data, I have produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
2. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#image: ![% of deaths by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not](static/data/covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png) 
#image: ![% of deaths by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not](static/data/covid_death_rate_icu.png) 

knitr::include_graphics("/static/img/blogs/covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("/static/img/blogs/covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static","data","covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static","data","covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

#knitr::include_graphics("covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
#knitr::include_graphics("covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

<p>As <em>‘third culture kid’</em>, born in London, but raised in expatriate communities, I have learned how to successfully navigate change and to embrace challenges. My diverse experience and value of different perspectives guided my decision to study for the Masters of Financial Analysis (MFA) at London Business School; an international community rooted in collaboration.</p>

<p>Other interests</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Firstly; I am passionate about reading and writing and so during my undergraduate degree, I founded a Bookclub. It ran for three years and get to over 30 members. Each member assigned a book and we met monthly to have discussions. This was a wonderful experience and I am subsequently, forming a Female Authors Bookclub at London Business School. My aim is formalise the bookclub and make it an official club at LBS.
Secondly; I love writing poetry and short stories. I completed an on-line Creative Writing Course in May with Penguin Random House. The objective was to develop a unique writing voice and teaching skills for effective writing. I am currently writing a short story/potential novel.
Thirdly, I have always loved cooking and in June 2019, I attended a short course at Le Corden Bleu in Paris specialising in French food. (to find our more about the course <a href="https://www.cordonbleu.edu/paris/culinary-workshop-the-art-of-cooking-like-a-chef/en" class="uri">https://www.cordonbleu.edu/paris/culinary-workshop-the-art-of-cooking-like-a-chef/en</a>).</p>

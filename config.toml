I have useful technical skills of data importing, data filtering and manipulation, visualization, inferential statistics, and data modelling. Data analytics is a complex and powerful tool. It can add value to many areas of business, and using the appropriate types of analyses, it can create simple but effective models that facilitate the communication of one’s reasoning and decision-making process."
